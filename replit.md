âœ… **Status Criteria Filter** - Filter source data by status values in addition to date range

## Deployment Instructions

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Create a new project

4. Add HTML file named exactly **"index"** (not index.html)
5. Copy content from **GAS_index.html** to the index file
6. Deploy as web app with execute permissions set to "Anyone"

## How Status Filtering Works

- The Status column in your Google Sheet will be automatically detected
- Users can optionally filter data by selecting a status from the dropdown
- If "All Statuses" is selected, no status filtering is applied
- Status filtering works in combination with date range filtering
